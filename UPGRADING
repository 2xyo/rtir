UPGRADE RTIR 1.0.x TO RTIR 1.1.x BETA IS NOT YET SUPPORTED.

We're still working to bullet-proof the RTIR beta process and will release
a second beta as soon as we're confident that we've got a procedure that
works well for folks.  We _will_ support upgrade from RTIR 1.0.x to RTIR
1.2.final.

Upgrading from RTIR 1.1.2:
--------------------------

Delete the "SetDueReopen" scrip from the Incident Reports,
Investigations, and Blocks queues.

Upgrading from RTIR 1.0.0:
--------------------------

RTIR now installs in RT's share/html directory rather than local/html,
making local modifications to RTIR easier.

1) IMPORTANT!  Back up any modifications that you've made to the
   /opt/rt3/local/html/RTIR directory.

2) Remove the old RTIR files:

   rm -r /opt/rt3/local/html/RTIR

3) Install RTIR by following the instructions below.
