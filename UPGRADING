General upgrade instructions
============================

0) Make a backup of the database. It's very important.

1) Layout of files in RT's directories have been changed in RT 3.8.0.
   Each extension is installed in its own directory and is activated
   using Plugins option.

   Also, some files have been renamed and delete, if you leave old
   files around, you can hurt functionality of the new version.

   If you're upgrading from RTIR 2.4 or newer, so RTIR is already
   is in local/plugins/RT-IR directory, then you can move it before
   proceding. Otherwise it's better to start from a new directory
   for this installtion instead of using directories with previous
   RT and extensions.

2) Install and upgrade database to the RT 3.8.4 or newer following
   its upgrade instructions.

2.1) Test how RT upgrade went. You should be able to start server,
     create tickets and do other things in the RT interface.

2.2) Make another backup of the DB, so you can return to this step
     if something goes wrong.

3) Install or upgrade RTFM 2.4.0 or newer.

3.1) Enable it in the RT config using @Plugins option

3.2) Test RT and RTFM again

4) Install the new version of RTIR. (DO NOT RUN "make initdb")

5) Update RTIR's database.

    Type:

        ls etc/upgrade

    For each item in that directory whose name is greater than
    your previously installed RTIR version, you must run upgrade
    commands.

    Each step is described below and may have additional instructions.
    Read them before running upgrade commands.

    For example if you had RTIR 1.1.1 then you should check
    instructions under "Applying changes from etc/upgrade/1.1.3"
    section below and run commands, then do the same with 1.9.0 dir
    and greater.

    *Note* that even if there is no etc/upgrade/<some version> dir
    then anyway *you must* read instructions below for all versions
    greater or equal to that you're upgrading from as some upgrades
    may require manual changes or describe important changes in
    the RTIR you should be aware of.

    Commands you should run to upgrade DB using data
    from etc/upgrade/<version> directory: If the dir has any schema
    files then run:

        /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba <dba> \
            --prompt-for-dba-password --action schema \
            --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

    If the dir has a file named 'content' then run:

        /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba <dba> \
            --prompt-for-dba-password --action insert \
            --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

Upgrading from 2.4.x and earlier
--------------------------------

1) _RTIR_ prefix has been deleted from all RTIR's custom fields. What
   means that you have to update custom code you have: templates,
   scrips and other customizations which may have name of a custom
   field hardcoded.

   Custom Fields with multiple words in the name and no spaces have
   been renamed, now there is space. These custom fields are:

       HowReported  => How Reported
       ReporterType => Reporter Type
       WhereBlocked => Where Blocked

   All these changes are implemented in F<etc/upgrade/2.5.1/content>
   file.

2) Saved searches are affected by above change and you can convert
   them using a script provided.

       perl -I /opt/rt3/local/lib -I/opt/rt3/lib etc/upgrade/2.5.1/update_saved_searches.pl

3) Some templates RTIR comes with contain code to insert values of
   CFs into emails. It is impossible to change these templates
   automatically. You have to do it manually. To identify templates
   and/or confirm that all has been changed you can use the following
   SQL query:

       SELECT id, Queue FROM Templates WHERE Content LIKE '%_RTIR_%';

   Usually this change is simple as deleting _RTIR_ prefix and adding
   a space to three names mentioned above.

   Some of your code may still use old names. Make sure to change
   that. The following command might help you identify places:

        find dir/ | xargs grep '_RTIR_'

2) _RTIR_*_default options in the config has been merged together
into RTIR_CustomFieldDefaults hash. Change site config accordingly.

Upgrading from 2.4.4 and earlier
-------------------------

SubjectTag was ignored in RTIR templates, so users could be confused.
Find all templates with the following text:

    [{$rtname} #{$Ticket->id}]

And replace it with:

    [{$Ticket->QueueObj->SubjectTag || $rtname} #{$Ticket->id}]

Upgrading from 2.3.17 and earlier
-------------------------

1) Layout of files in RT's directories have been changed in RT 3.8.0.
   Each extension is installed in its own directory and is activated
   using @Plugins options in the RT config.

2) By accident RTFM's CustomField Response could be created with MaxValues = 0
   what is incorrect and should be changed to 1, run the following query to
   update the DB.

    UPDATE CustomFields SET MaxValues = 1 WHERE
            Name = 'Response'
            AND Type = 'Text'
            AND LookupType = 'RT::FM::Class-RT::FM::Article'
            AND MaxValues = 0;

Upgrading from 2.3.15 and earlier
-------------------------

There was an error in the etc/upgrade/upgrade.pl script. It could skip
some incidents during upgrade. Run this script again, especially if you
never did that or ran with earlier versions of the RTIR. This script
updates Due dates on active incidents where it's not set and set to
the most recent due date of the active children.

Applying changes from upgrade/2.3.0
-------------------------

At these step no special actions are required, run the upgrade scripts where we
split out incidents owned by Nobody and the Current User on the most-due views
on the homepage.

Applying changes from upgrade/2.1.1
-------------------------

At these step no special actions are required, run the upgrade
scripts where we add several scrips that set 'Started' date
of tickets in the RTIR.

Applying changes from upgrade/2.1.0
-------------------------

At these step no special actions are required, run the upgrade
scripts where we do following things:

1) Apply the _RTIR_IP CF to all RTIR's queues and convert it to
multiple type. Also, we add several scrips to parse IP addresses
from incomming mails and to fill those into the CF.

2) The constituency field we apply to all RTIR's queues too and
and add several scrips to track values of the field.

Applying changes from upgrade/1.9.0
-------------------------

1) The LaunchMessage template in the Investigations queue
has been renamed into Autoreply without any changes of the content.
This upgrade step is automated, but may fail if you've changed
the LaunchMessage template.

2) In the Blocks queue an Autoreply template has been added. This is
replacement for the NewMessage template. Automated step doesn't delete
old template, you have to check that the new template suites your
needs and may be copy customizations from the old one, then delete
the NewMessage template.

3) NotifyOnLaunch and NotifyOnCreate scrips have been deleted in
the Implementations and the Blocks queues respectively. You have to
use the default RT's Autoreply scrip instead or create autoreply
scrips in these queues if global one is disabled or doesn't exist.
You need the following scrip in the queues:

  On Create AutoReply to Requestors with Template Autoreply

4) The new 'BlockRemoved' template has been added in the Blocks
queue. Check its content.

Applying changes from upgrade/1.1.3
-------------------------

No special steps required, just run upgrade scripts. Everything
is automated. At this step we install several new actions,
conditions and scrips that had been introduced in the RTIR 1.1.3.
Also, we change action of the 'SetDueReopen' scrips.

Applying changes from upgrade/1.1.1
-------------------------

1) At this step we switch from 'UserDefined' actions and conditions
   to modules, so all code would be in the lib directory. If you changed
   the code of the scrips then you have to port changes.

2) Run the etc/upgrade/upgrade.pl script. This script updates Due Dates
   on active incidents where it's not set and set to the most recent due
   date of the active children.

Applying changes from upgrade/1.0.3
-------------------------

No special steps required, just run upgrade scripts. Everything
is automated. At this step we grant the ShowTemplate right to
the DutyTeam group.

Upgrading from RTIR 1.0.0:
--------------------------

RTIR now installs in RT's local/plugins/RT-IR directory rather than local/html,
making local modifications to RTIR easier.

1) IMPORTANT!  Back up any modifications that you've made to the
   /opt/rt3/local/html/RTIR directory.

2) Remove the old RTIR files or better install everything into clean directory
   as described in the beginning of this file.
