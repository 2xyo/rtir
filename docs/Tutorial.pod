=head2 Merge

Merge operation allows users to merge two tickets into one.
This operation is pretty straight forward, everything that
could be joined is joined otherwise value of the target is
used.

Results of the action depends on direction, "merge the ticket #1
into #2" is not the same as "merge the ticket #2 into #1".
When you merge ticket #1 into #2 some properties of
the ticket #1 are joined with respective properties of
the ticket #2: TimeEstimated, TimeWorked, TimeLeft,
Requestors, Cc and AdminCc watchers and links. Other fields
are ignored. Duplicated links or watchers would be ignored,
also if there were links between #1 and #2 tickets then
it would be dropped.

Merge operation couldn't be reverted and should be applied with
caution.

User could merge tickets only he has right 'ModifyTicket' on
both tickets.

The RTIR's merge operation allows user to merge tickets within
tickets in the same queue. IRs and Investigations could be
merged too. When user opens ticket's display page there is 
'Merge' link on the page in the tabs. The Merge page is splitted
into two blocks. The first one is a list of other children of
the parent incident(s) of the current ticket. It's empty if
the ticket is not linked to incident(s) or if there is no
candidates to merge into. The second box contains other tickets
you can merge into, tickets are groupped by type if it's possible
to merge into different types(fro example an IR into an Investigation).

Use have to select one ticket from the list and submit form.
If everything is fine he is redirected to the ticket's main page
then.

When page has no ticket you're looking for you can click 'Refine'
and adjust search conditions then return back to merge window
by clicking 'Merge' tab.

Pure RT's merge action could be invoked from Advanced tab.
