=head2 Merge

RT's C<merge> operation allows users to merge two tickets into one.
This operation is pretty straight forward, everything that
RT can merge from the source ticket is added to the target ticket.
When only one value can be selected, RT prefers the value from
the target ticket.


The result of the action depends on the direction of the merge:
"merge ticket #1 into #2" is not the same as "merge ticket #2 
into #1".

When you merge ticket #1 into #2 some properties of
ticket #1 are joined with respective properties of
ticket #2: TimeEstimated, TimeWorked, TimeLeft, Requestors, 
Cc and AdminCc and links. Other fields from ticket #1 are 
ignored . Duplicated links or watchers will be condensed.,
also if there were links between tickets #1 and #2 then
RT will drop them

The merge operation can't be reversed and should be used with
caution.

Users can merge tickets only if they have the right 'ModifyTicket' 
on both tickets.

RTIR's merge operation allows a user to merge tickets with
tickets in the same queue. Within RTIR, IRs and Investigations 
can be merged. When a user opens a ticket's display page there is 
a 'Merge' option in the page's tabs. The Merge page is split
into two blocks. The first one is a list of other children of
the parent incident(s) of the current ticket. It's empty if
the ticket is not linked to any incidents or if there is no
candidate to merge into. 

The second box contains other tickets you can merge into, 
tickets are grouped by type, if it's possible to merge the
ticket into a ticket of another type. (for example, you can
merge an IR into an Investigation). Note that if a user
merges an IR into an Investigation then investigation is always
used as the target ticket.

You have to select one ticket from the list and submit form the.
If the merge completes succesfully, you'll be redirected to the 
target ticket's main page.

When the merge page doesn't have the ticket you're looking for,
you can click 'Refine' to adjust the search conditions before
returning to the merge page by clicking the 'Merge' tab.

You can access RT's generic merge from an RTIR ticket's 'Advanced'
tab.

=head2 Split

Split operation allows user to create new ticket from the existing one.
When a user selects the 'Split' tab he will see a new ticket creation form 
with information prefilled from the original ticket, for example Subject, 
Owner, Correspondents(Requestors), Ccs, AdminCs, as well as the original ticket's
history, formatted as text in the message box. The user can change any and all
values before creating a new ticket.

"Split" tickets cand only be created in the same queue as the ticket they're
split from.

=head2 Abandon and Reject

These operations are quite similar to each other. A rejected ticket is not
availble for many operations and this state is treated as inactive.

Rejected tickets are still available for searches and can be reopened, 
but RTIR's default interfaces hide are designed to hide such tickets, 
so people can concentrate on new and open tickets.

The abandon action allows a user to reject an incident and all its children.
