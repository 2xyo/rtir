=head1 Upgrading RTIR

This document provides general instructions for upgrading
RTIR to the most recent version regardless of the version you
are currently using. In addition to these instructions, you should look
in the version-specific UPGRADING files provided in this distribution
for additional upgrade steps. Instructions for upgrading RT
are provided with the RT distribution.

RT and RTIR are commercially-supported software. If you need help
upgrading your RTIR instance or need other services related to RT
or RTIR, please get in touch with us at <sales@bestpractical.com>.

=head1 General Upgrade Instructions

=over

=item 1

B<VERY IMPORTANT!> Make a backup of your database.
These upgrade scripts often make changes to the database. If you don't
make a backup and something doesn't go as planned, you may
lose data.

=item 2

Upgrade your RT installation to RT 4.0.14 or newer following
its upgrade instructions. Make sure you follow all of the
steps and upgrade both the code and the database.

As noted in the RT documentation, it is recommended that you
use a fresh directory when upgrading to RT 4.0, like /opt/rt4,
rather than upgrading on top of your RT 3 installation.
A lot of files have been deleted and moved around in RTIR 3.0,
so don't copy old RTIR's files.

=item 3

Test your upgraded RT. You should be able to start the server,
log in, use the RT web interface, create tickets, send email to
RT, receive mail from RT, etc.

=item 4

Make another backup of the DB, so you can return to this step
if something goes wrong.

=item 5

Install the new version of RTIR. B<DO NOT> run C<make initdb>.

=item 6

Review all of the upgrade notes in docs/UPGRADING-*. If you were
coming from 2.4.1, you would read UPGRADING-2.4, UPGRADING-2.6 and
UPGRADING-3.0.

=item 7

Update RTIR's database.

Type:

    make upgrade-database

Answer the prompt for which version of RTIR you are upgrading from. RT
will then confirm the upgrades that it is going to apply and will run
them in sequence.

=item 8

Re-analyze and re-optimize your database tables.

When you have completed all of the upgrade steps, you will
likely need to update any optimizations you have done since the
underlying tables have probably changed.
