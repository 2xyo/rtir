=head1 Upgrading RTIR

This document provides general instructions for upgrading
RTIR to the most recent version regardless of the version you
are currently using. In addition to these instructions, you should look
in the version-specific UPGRADING files provided in this distribution
for additional upgrade steps. Instructions for upgrading RT
are provided with the RT distribution.

RT and RTIR are commercially-supported software. If you need help
upgrading your RTIR instance or need other services related to RT
or RTIR, please get in touch with us at <sales@bestpractical.com>.

=head1 General Upgrade Instructions

=over

=item 1

B<VERY IMPORTANT!> Make a backup of your database.
These upgrade scripts often make changes to the database. If you don't
make a backup and something doesn't go as planned, you may
lose data.

=item 2

Upgrade your RT installation to RT 4.0.6 or newer following
its upgrade instructions. Make sure you follow all of the
steps and upgrade both the code and the database.

As noted in the RT documentation, it is recommended that you
use a fresh directory when upgrading to RT 4.0, like /opt/rt4,
rather than upgrading on top of your RT 3 installation.
A lot of files have been deleted and moved around in RTIR 3.0,
so don't copy old RTIR's files.

=item 3

Test your upgraded RT. You should be able to start the server,
log in, use the RT web interface, create tickets, send email to
RT, receive mail from RT, etc.

=item 4

Make another backup of the DB, so you can return to this step
if something goes wrong.

=item 5

Install the new version of RTIR. B<DO NOT> run C<make initdb>.

=item 6

Update RTIR's database.

Type:

    ls etc/upgrade

For each item in that directory whose name is greater than
your previously installed RTIR version (a later version),
you must run upgrade commands.

Each step is described below and may have additional instructions.
Read them before running upgrade commands.

For example, if you had RTIR 1.1.1 then you should read the
instructions under L<UPGRADING-2.4/"Applying Changes from upgrade/1.1.3">,
run the commands, then do the same with 1.9.0 directory
and greater until you have run all of the commands.

Note that even if there is no etc/upgrade/<some version>
directory for a particular version, you must still read the
instructions for all remaining versions greater than or
equal to the version you're upgrading from. Some upgrades
may require manual changes or describe important changes in
RTIR you should be aware of. Missing a set of upgrade
instructions can result in strange behavior that can be very hard
to diagnose.

If the upgrade directory has any C<schema> files, run:

    /opt/rt4/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba <dba> \
        --prompt-for-dba-password --action schema \
        --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

If the upgrade directory has a file named C<content> then run:

    /opt/rt4/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba <dba> \
        --prompt-for-dba-password --action insert \
        --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

=item 7

Re-analyze and re-optimize your database tables.

When you have completed all of the upgrade steps, you will
likely need to update any optimizations you have done since the
underlying tables have probably changed.
