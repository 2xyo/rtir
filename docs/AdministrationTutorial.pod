=head2 Maintaining DB size, deleting entries

During normal operation RT/RTIR don't delete data from the database.
However, since RT 3.7 an extension has been integrated into RT that
allow you to delete records in the DB. Its name is Shredder.
You can find documentation for this extension in
`perldoc lib/RT/Shredder.pm`.
