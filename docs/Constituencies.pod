=head1 REQUIREMENTS for Multiple Constituency functionality

 SWITCHCERT, and several other CSIRT’s provide services for more than one constituency.
For a variety of reasons, it makes sense to separate these constituencies, particularly when handling
incidents. However, it also makes sense to use the same tools when working on these separate sources
of data. Depending on the constituency different users may wish to work on incidents within different
queues or have access to incident data held within different queues. Therefore, access is required,
which allows user privileges depending on the constituency. RTIR does not support this out of the
box. Of course it would be possible to install one separate instance of RTIR per constituency. But this
is somewhat cumbersome, as a lot of the configuration is identical on all instances, hence errorprone.
A better solution would be to integrate the facility of handling several constituencies within the same
instances of RTIR.

D.3.5.1. We MUST be able to define more than one constituency.
D.3.5.2. We MUST be able to define Access Control Lists according to the constituency.
D.3.5.3. We MUST preset the constituency according to mail traffic.
D.3.5.4. RTIR MUST allow constituency inheritance of newly created tickets in any RTIR
queue (incident report, incident, blocks, investigation)

=head2 Definitions 

  A constituency is defined by:
  * By it’s name.
  * Its correspondence email address.
  * Associated ACLs.
  * Assigning a constituency to a ticket:
  ** On new incoming incident report, the constituency is preset
     automatically according the email address the email is sent to.
  ** Any new incidents created from incident reports, or blocks and
     investigations, created from incidents inherit the constituency
     from the launching ticket.
  ** Manually assign the constituency to any new tickets created from
     within RTIR, not yet related to any other ticket.
  ** Manually change the constituency of a ticket and all its related
     tickets.

Of course the last two points require that the user has the right to do so,
according to the ACLs. All tickets must belong to a constituency.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS 

=head2 Constituency values

Constituency is a custom field that applies to all RTIR's queues. Administrator
can manage the field and its values via the web interface: RT -> Configuration ->
Custom Fields -> click on '_RTIR_Constituency' record in the list. At the bottom
of the page there is control elements to add, delete and rename values of
the constituency field(D.3.5.1).

=head2 ACLs

RTIR allows you to grant additional rights to tickets based on their
constituency by means of "pseudo" queues.

For example, assume you have two constituencies "EDUNET" and "GOVNET".
Your RTIR instance consists of four queues: Incident Reports,
Incidents, Investigations and Blocks.  To grant the user "Edward"
the right to work with EDUNET Incident Reports, you'll need to
create a new queue, "Incident Reports - EDUNET".  Make "Edward" an
AdminCc of the new queue, either directly or as a member of a group
like "DutyTeam - EDUNET".

You should grant that user or group the rights you want them to
have to tickets in the "Incident Reports" queue. It is important
that you NOT grant the user or group "queue-wide" rights sunch as
"See Queue" or "Create Ticket" in the pseudo-queue as the system
will apply those rights to the pseudo-queue "Incident Reports -
EUDNET" and NOT to the "Incident Reports" queue.

=head2 Outgoing mail: "CorrespondAddress" and "CommentAddress"

If you create queues as described in the ACL section, their
correspondence and comment addresses will override the original
queue's where possible.



It is important to note that these additional rights do NOT also add new mailing rules.  


=head2 Presetting constituency according to mail traffic

Many mail transfer agents (MTAs) allow you to specify a flag on any incoming
email message by appending "+flag" after an email address. (This option
is supported by postfix, sendmail, qmail, exim and others, though the "+" delimiter
has different defaults on some systems and can be customized by a site's systems
administrator)

RTIR's multiple constituency support uses this extension mechanism to allow
a single queue to receive mail for multiple constituencies. If you have two
constituencies, EDUNET and GOVNET, you might set up RTIR's "incident report"
address as follows in /etc/aliases:

    edu: abuse+edunet
    gov: abuse+govnet
    abuse: "|/path/to/rt-mailgate ...mailgate options..."

rt-mailgate script expect that MTA sets the EXTENSION environment variable
with value of "flag". Script adds this value to the incoming message in
the 'X-RT-Mail-Extension' header's field.

=head2 Constituency inheritance

* If incoming mail has 'X-RT-Mail-Extension: <valid constituency value>'
  header field then new ticket is created and constituency set according
  to field value. See 'Presetting constituency according to mail traffic'
  above.
* If user uses 'New' or 'Launch' links on the main view of an incident,
  investigation, incident report or block to create new linked ticket
  then creation page contains predefined value for constituency and couldn't
  be changed at this step.
* Changing constituency value is possible through the 'Edit' page. RTIR
  updates all related tickets too during this action.

Note that during linking tickets together list of possible candidates
is not restricted by constituency of the former ticket, so user may
choose targets with different constituencies. In the latter case new
constituency value is not defined as it wasn't defined in requirements.
We hope to get some feedback from you on this subject during testing.
