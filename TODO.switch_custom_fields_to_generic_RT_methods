* Names of custom fields were localized in RTIR, we should localize them in RTIR as well

* Stripping of _RTIR_ prefix results in changes of searches: Formats and Queries, write
  an upgrader for saved searches

* Rename some fields to variants with spaces

* Custom fields in Incident display are very specific and mixed with generic RT properties

* Description CF in Incidents had Cols => 60 argument, check if we preserve behaviour

* On edit State need special treating for Blocks
* Constituency has special treating on edit depending on constituency propagation mode
** These two custom fields are still massaged via callback and RTIR has special editor

Implemented changes:

* RTIR's custom fields are renamed, no more '_RTIR_' prefix. As well some CFs had two
  word names, spaces have been added. Handled in upgrade script.

* Autoreply and BlockRemoved templates in blocks queue need changes. Block that adds
  CF values to the mail should be:

    { my $output = "";
      my @mailfields = ( 'IP', 'Netmask', 'Port', 'Where Blocked' );

      my $CustomFields = $Ticket->QueueObj->TicketCustomFields;
      while ( my $CustomField = $CustomFields->Next ) {
        my $name = $CustomField->Name;
        next unless grep lc $_ eq lc $name, @mailfields;

        my $Values = $Ticket->CustomFieldValues( $CustomField->Id );
        while ( my $Value = $Values->Next ) {
          $output .= $name .": ". $Value->Content ."\n";
        }
      }
      return $output;
    }
