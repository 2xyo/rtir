CHANGES IN 2.4.0 SINCE RTIR 1.0
-------------------------------

Full integration with RT 3.8.

New Search UI

    This includes a 3.8-style search UI, and menu changes to
    accomodate this.  Instead of search results and criteria being
    displayed on a single page, you can now choose the 'Refine' menu
    option to refine your search and re-run it after you've added all
    of your criteria. This also includes extracting results to RSS and
    spreadsheet formats.

Configurable Search Results

    Search result formats are configurable in the RTIR configuration
    file, so you can easily choose which fields you would like to have
    displayed for RTIR searches.

Configurable RTIR home page

    You can choose which components (portlets) you want to see on
    RTIR's main page, including portlets from both RTIR and core RT.

Per user interface configuration
    
    Users can change RT's appearance through their preferences,
    including adjusting portlets, default search results, and ticket
    transaction order.

Integration between RTIR and RTFM

    Now RTIR is detects if RTFM is installed, and adds default RTFM
    classes, templates and rights for better integration with RTIR.

Create Incident with Investigation

    New interface allows the user to create an Incident and run an
    Investigation from the same page..

Incident Reports can be linked to multiple Incidents.

Quick states filter

    While browsing children linked to an incident you can filter the
    list by the their state.

Bulk Abandon

    Multiple Incidents can be abandoned from a single form.

Disable Blocks queue
    
    Blocks queue and its functionality can be disabled in the RTIR
    configuration file.

Advanced operations with RTIR tickets

    New 'Advanced' ticket's subtab allows the user to move misplaced
    tickets, merge wayward responses, and do other low-level
    maintainance tasks.

Business::SLA

    Service Level Agreement (SLA) calculations are now handled by the
    Business::SLA module, which offers more flexibility.  You can
    specify SLAs with business minutes, real minutes, or both.

Scrips

    RTIR-specific scrip actions and conditions are now in perl
    modules, so they're easier to customize.

Standardized Components

    RTIR 2.4 uses more of RT's core components, making it easier to
    customize and maintain.
