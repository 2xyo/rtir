RT for Incident Response is an open source, industrial-grade
incident-handling tool designed to provide a simple, effective
workflow for members of CERT and CSIRT teams. It allows team members
to track, respond to and deal with reported incidents and features a
number of tools to make common operations quick and easy.  RTIR is
built on top of "RT," which is also available for free from Best
Practical Solutions at http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/.

Upgrade instructions:
-----------------------

If you've installed a prior version of RTIR, you may need to follow
special steps to upgrade.  See the UPGRADING file for detailed
information.


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

1) Once RT 3.7 and other required package have been installed and
   appear to be working properly, cd to the directory into which you
   unpacked RTIR into.  If you plan on using RTFM with RTIR, please
   install RTFM before installing RTIR.  Please also make sure RTFM
   database is initalized with "make initdb".

2) Run "perl Makefile.PL" to generate a makefile for RTIR. 

3) Type "make install".

4) Add the following lines to your RT_SiteConfig.pm file:

   # The RTIR config file

   $RTIR_CONFIG_FILE = $RT::LocalEtcPath."/IR/RTIR_Config.pm";

   require $RTIR_CONFIG_FILE
     || die ("Couldn't load RTIR config file '$RTIR_CONFIG_FILE'\n$@");

5) If you are installing RTIR for the first time, initialize the RTIR
   database by typing "make initdb".

   WARNING: Do not attempt to re-initialize the database if you are
   upgrading.

6) Stop and start your web server.  



Configuring RTIR
----------------

1) Using RT's configuration interface, add the email address
   of the Network Operations Team (the people who will handle
   activating and removing Blocks) as AdminCC on the Blocks queue.

2) You may want to modify the email messages that are automatically
   sent on the creation of Investigations and Blocks.

3) By default, RT ships with a number of global Scrips.  You should use 
   RT's configuration interface to look through them, and disable any 
   that aren't apropriate in your environment.

4) Add staff members who handle incidents to the DutyTeam group.

5) You can override values in the RTIR_Config.pm in your
   RT_SiteConfig.pm file. Just add your customizations after the "require" 
   line mentioned above.


SETTING UP THE MAIL GATEWAY 
---------------------------

An alias for the Incident Reports  queue will need to be made in either 
your global mail aliases file (if you are using NIS) or locally on your
machine.
 
Add the following lines to /etc/aliases (or your local equivalent) :

rtir:         "|/opt/rt3/bin/rt-mailgate --queue 'Incident Reports' --action correspond --url http://localhost/"

You should substitute the URL for RT's web interface for "http://localhost/".

** If you're configuring RTIR with support for multiple constituencies, please
refer to the instructions in the file  docs/Constituencies.pod
