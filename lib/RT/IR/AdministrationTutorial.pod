=head2 Maintaining DB size, deleting entries

During normal operation RT/RTIR never deletes data from the database.
Since RT 3.7 the RTx::Shredder extension has been integrated into
RT.  This extension can remove data such as Users or Tickets
from the RT/RTIR system. You can find documentation for this 
extension in in L<RT::Shredder>  by running `perldoc lib/RT/Shredder.pm`
